# Sleepy shell script
### Perfect sleep time calculation for your bash!

This robot tells you when to get up and wake up so you are kinda controlled, but trust me - it's cool. Probably the most powerful thing I'll ever write.

## Installation

Sleepy is a shell script (the title kinda dictates it). Make sure you add it to your '$PATH' and you'll be alright.

## Usage

Run sleepy -h and see what happens.

	EXAMPLES:
    sleepy 10:30
    #=> TRY to go to bed @ 23:46 01:16 02:56 02:36 05:46 07:16
    # sleepy without parameters returns the time to get up as if you would get to bed right now
    sleepy
    #=> TRY to get up @ 08:44 07:14 05:44 04:14 02:44 01:14
